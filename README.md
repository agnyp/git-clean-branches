# git-clean-branches

Little script that helps you clean up the local-branch-mess, if you have one.

## Install

The easiest way is to copy or soft-link the script into you path.

If you want it to look nice, like in the example below, rename it to just `git-clean-branches` without the `.sh`.

Git has a nice feature: If your path contains an executable starting with git-*
you can use it your git-repository like this:

```
git clean-branches
```

Of course you can also execute it directly within the repo.

## Usage

The script does nothing without you explicitly giving the command. If you simply press <Enter> all the time, nothing will change.

After first question for fetching from origin, you can press `?` for HELP.

## Contribution

If you want to contribute consider only PR which would be benefical for all users.
If you plan on something specific I suggest a fork.
