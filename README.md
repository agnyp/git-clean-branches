# git-clean-branches

Little script that helps you clean up the local-branch-mess, if you have one.

## Usage

The easiest way is to copy or soft-link the script into you path.
Git has a nice feature: If your path contains an executable starting with git-*
you can use it like this in your git-repository:

```
git clean-branches
```

Of course you can also call it directly within the repo.

## Contribution

If you want to contribute consider only PR which would be benefical for all users.
If you plan on something specific I suggest a fork.
